# Deque

- Deque (Double Ended Queue) is implemented using `collections` module.
- Deque is preferred over a list in  cases where we need faster append and pop operations from both ends of the container, as deque provides:
    - `O(1)` time complexity for **append** and **pop** operations.
- Compared to a list that provides `O(n)` for pop operation.
